# Clarity Website 
---
## Strategy

### Who is the site for?
    - Users looking for a mindfulness exercise
    - Users who want to relax and clear their mind

### What do we know about our demographic?
    - Site is based for general public
    - Mindfulness is a growing in popularity at a huge rate. According to the below journal, it can be estimated that just below 8 million adults in Britain had learnt to  practice mindfulness.
    - Though the data is not readily available to us, with a sample of the population that large, we can assume that users can be a variety of ages, backgrounds and genders.

   [Awareness and Experience of Mindfulness in Britain](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1360780420980761)

### Is the content relevant / is the technology appropriate?
    - Referencing the above journal, 15% of those interviewed had learned to practice mindfulness via a website, with a further 35% learning via an app. This indicates a high level of engagement with technology though the site should still follow conventions and be easily accessible for the remaining 50% who may not have experienced mindfulness through technology before.

### Site Goals
    - Provide a calm experience for the user
    - Provide a distraction technique of a small game should the user be experiencing anxiety or stress.
    - Provide an interactive experience, where the user has control over the displayed image to suit them.
    - Be fully responsive so the site is functional on desktop or via tablet and mobile.

### Why would a user want this?
    - A quick and accessible site to practice mindfulness whether at home, at the office or on the go.
    - A general calming experience

### What makes a good mindfulness website user experience?
	
    - Information is presented in a clear, accessible format
    - Website fulfils expected conventions. Nav bar across the top or under a header. Footer at the bottom of the page for contact information / social links.
    - Aesthetically pleasing. Relevant images and video content if applicable. Colour choice also subject specific
    - Provide some sort of identifying feature, in this case the site name 'Clarity'
    - Calm simple aesthetics and animations if applicable. No automatic sound or anything that could appear overwhelming to the user.
    - Easy access to the desired content. The site will not contain a huge amount of text or information as it is not applicable to the site goal or user experience. Instead the main aim of the site, the mindfulness exercise will take priority.

## Scope
    -Within this first release, the priority for the site is to provide a Mindfulness exercise for the user. Though other features have been listed above, due to time constraints on the project, they would not be able to be implemented until a further release. The table above could however be used to prioritise features should they be implemented in the future.

## Structure
    - Site will only have one page with navigation available via scrolling to reach the footer
    - The exercise as mentioned will have dominance so will be visible as soon as the page loads
    - The user will be presented with an immediate choice of theme for the exercise.

## Skeleton
    - Logo / site name centralised across the head of the page, as a nav is not currently needed in this release.
    - Keep colours of the surrounding site quite subdued and calming
    - Keep text as minimal as possible, lean on images and logos.
